## ABOUT

`Seedly` is an app for gardeners and planters with a focus on seed planting. The app provides the user with Autumn frost date averages by lattitute and longitude.

It also provides an easy way for users to store information about their seeds and where they are planted.

##### Versions

*current* `V. 1.1.0` provides users the abilitiy to calculate sow by dates for individual seeds they have added to their account based on their local frost date.

`V. 1.1.1` will fix the date range on the 'see your seeds' page. Currently adding seeds dates more than once will add times to the seed rather than replacing the previous times.

`V. 1.2.0` It will provide users with the ability to create and store `beds`, which will contain any seed info they upload into it. Finally, the next update will allow users to find their frost date averages by location or zipcode rather than by latitude and longitude.
